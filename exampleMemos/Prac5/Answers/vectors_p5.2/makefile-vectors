#this might make a good example of a more "advanced" makefile for students
#I know in practice many people use make, but don't ever write big makefiles
#instead, they autogenerate makefiles with other tools such as ./configure, scons, automake, etc.
#(because let's be honest: you don't want to spend time coding a big makefile)
#however this could still be useful for teaching students more about make's abilities:

CPP=g++
LINKER=g++
CFLAGS=-Wall -Wfatal-errors

vectors.out: main.o vectors.o
	$(LINKER) main.o vectors.o -o vectors.out

main.o: main.cpp vectors.h
	$(CPP) -c $(CFLAGS) main.cpp

vectors.o: vectors.cpp vectors.h
	$(CPP) -c $(CFLAGS) vectors.cpp

main.cpp:
	echo You don't have a file called main.cpp

vectors.cpp:
	echo You don't have a file called vectors.cpp
