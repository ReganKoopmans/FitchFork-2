Software design erosion is a phenomenon studied in more detail by oth-
ers such as van Gurp and Bosch [14]. It can occur whenever changes are
repeatedly made to a working system order to fit new requirements. It
especially occurs when said changes only modify enough of the system
(partially) effect the desired outcome without a adequate rethinking of the
design or updates to other related parts of a software system. For exam-
ple: some functions of the system might be (partially) obsoleted by the new
change, but since the system At some point the effort of redesign becomes greater (at least in the short term) than the effort of simply
“hacking” another change onto the system, so the erosion effect snowballs
over time (similar to erosion in geography; there is also some similarity 
the “broken window effect” observed in urban neighbourhoods [44] [41] –
“if a window in a building broken and is left unrepaired, all the rest of the
windows will soon be broken”).
