# FitchFork-2
This project is for the re-design and re-implementation of the fitchfork code assessment system.

To render the project documentation, go to documentation/spec or opne of its sub-directories and run pdflatex xxx_doc.tex.

Raw notes whose info needs to be assimilated into the documentation can be put into documentation/ad-hoc.

The latex directory has purely some technical latex stuff used in the spec document.
