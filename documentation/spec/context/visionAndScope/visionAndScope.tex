    \end{itemize}
  \item the ability to build a project using provided artifacts and metadata,
  \item the ability to execute the code in order to test the implemented functionality,
  \item the ability to perform dynamic analysis of the code, 
  \item providing feedback and marks based on any of the above.    
\end{itemize}
